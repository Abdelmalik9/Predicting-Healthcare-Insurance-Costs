# Predicting-Healthcare-Insurance-Costs
# Description:

This project involves developing a linear regression model to predict individual healthcare insurance costs based on demographic and lifestyle features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to understand the linear relationship between these variables and insurance charges, and to build a model that can accurately estimate future costs.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Performance is evaluated using metrics like RÂ² score, and visualizations of actual vs. predicted costs.

Key Steps:

* Conducted EDA to uncover trends and outliers

* Preprocessed data including encoding categorical variables

* Built a linear regression model to predict insurance charges

* Interpreted coefficients to understand impact of each feature

* Evaluated model performance and identified limitations

# Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels.api
